  ## Installation
  Please download the files located in this [repository](https://github.com/kristinmoon/lets-get-technical) to create a new blog, however, I invite you to join in on the conversation by posting and commenting at [Let's Get Technical](https://powerful-temple-08997.herokuapp.com/), rather than creating an entirely new blog. 
  
  You will need to use express-handlebars package to use Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers. You’ll also need the dotenv package to use environment variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session, and connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.
